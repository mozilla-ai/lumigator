# Lumigator Frontend

This directory contains the **frontend** code for the **Lumigator** project, built with **Vue 3**, and **Vite**. It is a modular and scalable front-end application designed to interact with the backend API provided by the Lumigator backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: The progressive JavaScript framework for building modern web interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server that supports modern JavaScript and hot module replacement (HMR).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already) and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator.git
   cd lumigator/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

To run the frontend locally for development purposes, use the following command to start the Vite development server. This will also enable hot-reloading, so changes you make in the code will be reflected instantly in the browser.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The application runs at this address by default.

### Build for Production

To build the frontend for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will bundle the frontend code into a production-ready, optimized set of static assets located in the `dist` directory. By default `dist` is placed in project's root directory ( `./frontend` in this case) .

### Linting and Code Formatting

For consistent code formatting and linting across multiple contributors, ESLint and Prettier are configured. To run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To fix linting issues automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Environment Variables

To configure environment variables, create an `.env` file in the root of the `frontend` directory with the following structure:

```bash
VUE_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api  # Backend API URL
```

You can add other environment-specific variables as needed.
