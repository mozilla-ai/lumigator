# Running Lumigator Locally with Docker-Compose

You can run and develop Lumigator locally using `docker-compose`, which creates four container services networked together to make up all the components of the Lumigator application.
Despite the fact this is a local setup, it lends itself to more distributed scenarios: e.g. one could provide different AWS_* env vars to the backend container to connect to Amazon’s / CoreWeave’s AWS instead of localstack, a different RAY_HEAD_NODE_HOST to move compute to a remote ray cluster, and so on.

The four services are:

 - `postgres` - SQL database holding metadata for datasets and experiments. You can connect to it with any SQL client (e.g. pgAdmin) using localhost:5432 as its address,  `uname=admin` and `password=password`
 - `localstack` - local storage for datasets that mimics S3-API compatible functionality. You can test your localstack setup as follows:
   - `brew install peak/tap/s5cmd`
   - add the following to ~/.zshrc (and source it, or directly run the following commands)
    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
    export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
    alias s5='s5cmd --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL'
   ```
  - Check out the storage: `s5 ls`
  - Check out the lumigator bucket: `s5 ls s3://lumigator-storage` (this will be created only after some action is performed on S3, e.g. uploading a dataset)


 - `backend` - the lumigator REST API. Lumigator’s FastAPI backend. You can directly connect to its [OpenAPI spec at localhost](http://localhost/docs#), see the available endpoints, and interactively run commands.
 - `ray` - a Ray cluster for submitting lm-buddy jobs and serving Ray Serve. You can connect to its dashboard [via HTTP to this address](http://localhost:8265/), see the cluster status, running jobs, their logs, etc. 

`docker-compose` automatically creates a network between these four containers. To use it, run `make local-up` at
the root of the repo, which will spin up then access the OpenAPI spec at `127.0.0.1/docs` to see and test all the endpoints.

You can run `make local-down` to spin down the server. The code is automatically reloaded by mounting as a volume,

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ../:/mzai
```

so if you configure your IDE to do so,
you can develop right within the Docker container and have the application immediately reflect the changes via
`CMD ["uvicorn", "backend.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80",  "--reload"]`

The main dockerfile is `Dockerfile.backend`, which ships the deployment code to the Ray cluster via a mounted volume, and the application itself,
which is shipped directly as a dir via Docker.

In order to use the API-based vendor ground truth generation and evaluation, you'll need to pass the following environment variables for credentials:
+ `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
+ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
into the docker container.
