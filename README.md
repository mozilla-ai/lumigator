Lumigator is an open-source platform developed by [Mozilla.ai](https://www.mozilla.ai/) to help
users select the most suitable language model for their specific needs. Currently, Lumigator
supports the evaluation of summarization tasks using sequence-to-sequence models such as BART and
BERT, as well as causal models like GPT and Mistral. We plan to expand support to additional machine
learning tasks and use cases in the future.

To learn more about Lumigator's features and capabilities, see the
[documentation](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/lumigator/), or get started with the
[example notebook](/notebooks/walkthrough.ipynb) for a platform API walkthrough.

> [!NOTE]
> Lumigator is in the early stages of development. It is missing important features and

## Why Lumigator?

As more organizations turn to AI for solutions, they face the challenge of selecting the best model
from an ever-growing list of options. The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, with [twice as many new
models released in 2023 compared to the previous year](https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-report).
Yet, in spite of the wealth of metrics available, there‚Äôs still no standard way to compare these
models.

[The 2024 AI Index Report](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2024.pdf)
highlighted that AI evaluation tools aren‚Äôt (yet) keeping up with the pace of development, making it
harder for developers and businesses to make informed choices. Without a clear single method for
comparing models, many teams end up using suboptimal solutions, or just choosing models based on
hype, slowing down product progress and innovation.

With Lumigator MVP, Mozilla.ai aims to make model selection transparent, efficient, and empowering.
Lumigator provides a framework for comparing LLMs, using task-specific metrics to evaluate how well
a model fits your project‚Äôs needs. With Lumigator, we want to ensure that you‚Äôre not just picking a
model‚Äîyou‚Äôre picking the right model for your use case.

## Get started

The simplest way to set up Lumigator is to deploy it locally using Docker Compose. To this end, you
need to have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- A working installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
    - On a Mac, you need Docker Desktop `4.3` or later and docker-compose `1.28` or later.
    - On Linux, you need to follow the
      [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
- The system Python; no version manager, such as pyenv, should be active.

You can run and develop Lumigator locally using Docker Compose. This creates three container
services networked together to make up all the components of the Lumigator application:

- `localstack`: Local storage for datasets that mimics S3-API compatible functionality.
- `backend`: Lumigator‚Äôs FastAPI REST API.
- `ray`: A Ray cluster for submitting several types of jobs.

> [!NOTE]
> Lumigator requires an SQL database to hold metadata for datasets and jobs. The local deployment
> uses SQLite for this purpose.

To start Lumigator locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Lumigator repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mozilla-ai/lumigator.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the repository root directory:

    ```bash
    cd lumigator
    ```

1. Start Lumigator using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    make start-lumigator
    ```

To verify that Lumigator is running, open a web browser and navigate to
[`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000). You should get the following response:

```json
{"Hello": "Lumigator!üêä"}
```

Despite the fact this is a local setup, it lends itself to more distributed scenarios. For instance,
one could provide different `AWS_*` environment variables to the backend container to connect to any
provider‚Äôs S3-compatible service, instead of localstack. Similarly, one could provide a different
`RAY_HEAD_NODE_HOST` to move compute to a remote ray cluster, and so on. See
[here](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/blob/7be2518ec8c6bc59ab8463fc7c39aad078bbb386/docker-compose.external.yaml)
for an example of how to do this, and see the
[operational guides](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/lumigator/operations-guide/kubernetes.html) in the
documentation for more deployment options.

Now that Lumigator is running, you can start using it. The platform provides a REST API that allows
you to interact with the system. Run the [example notebook](/notebooks/walkthrough.ipynb) for a
quick walkthrough.

To stop the containers you started using Docker Compose, simply run the following command:

```bash
make stop-lumigator
```
