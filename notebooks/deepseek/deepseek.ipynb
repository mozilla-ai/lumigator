    "# Zero-Shot Evaluation of DeepSeek R1 Models for Clinical Conversation Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepSeek family of models represents an interesting advancement in reasoning-specialized language models. While DeepSeek published evaluation results in [their paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948) (see Table 5), I wanted to understand specifically how the various Distilled R1 models compare to the full R1 model on a practical use case: clinical conversation summarization using the ACI-Bench dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Lumigator** to systematically evaluate and compare these models. Lumigator provides a framework to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coordinate multiple model evaluations against the same dataset\n",
    "2. Execute inference requests across different model deployments\n",
    "3. Calculate standardized metrics for performance comparison\n",
    "4. Organize and visualize the results for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Lumigator\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, you'll need to have Lumigator running. In a terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:mozilla-ai/lumigator.git\n",

    "## Dataset: ACI-Bench for Clinical Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation uses the ACI-Bench dataset, which was introduced in the paper \n",
    "[\"ACI-Bench: a Novel Benchmark for Ambient Clinical Intelligence\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02487-3) \n",
    "(Yim et al., 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "ACI-Bench was specifically designed to evaluate AI systems on their ability to \n",
    "understand doctor-patient conversations and generate accurate clinical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The test split of ACI-Bench that we'll be using consists of 40 doctor-patient conversations. \n",
    "These conversations aren't from real patient encounters but were created through professional medical simulations \n",
    "with standardized patients (actors trained to portray patients) and licensed physicians. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach attempts to keep the data reasonably realistic while also being HIPAA-compliant, \n",
    "as no actual protected health information is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each conversation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A full transcript of the simulated clinical encounter, with speaker identification\n",
    "2. Human-written reference documentation\n",
    "3. Various sections of the standard clinical note format (SOAP - Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Assessment & Plan Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this evaluation, we're specifically working with the **assessment and plan section** (`clef_taskC_test3_assessment_and_plan.json`), which is particularly challenging as it requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying the patient's medical conditions\n",
    "- Understanding the physician's diagnostic reasoning\n",
    "- Summarizing the recommended treatment approach\n",
    "- Capturing follow-up plans and contingencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of clinical documentation represents higher-level medical reasoning compared to other sections, making it a interesting test of a model's capacity for complex medical summarization and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in our dataset contains:\n",
    "- `examples`: The full doctor-patient conversation transcript (with speaker turns marked as `[doctor]` and `[patient]`)\n",
    "- `ground_truth`: The human-written assessment and plan section that serves as the reference summary\n",
    "- `id`: A unique identifier for each conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assessment & Plan task was featured in the 2023 MEDIQA-CHAT shared task at CLEF (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum)"

    "### Limitations of This Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation has several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown Training Data Exposure**: We cannot verify whether DeepSeek models were trained on the ACI-Bench dataset or similar clinical conversations. If any of these models were exposed to this data during training, they would have an unfair advantage in this evaluation - essentially having already \"seen the answers\" to the test. Without model cards or detailed training information disclosing training datasets, this remains an unknown factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relative Comparison Focus**: Given this limitation, our analysis primarily focuses on the relative performance differences between models within the DeepSeek family, rather than making absolute claims about their capabilities for clinical summarization. By comparing models from the same family, we can still draw meaningful conclusions about how performance scales with model size and architecture (Llama vs. Qwen) when all models would have had the same potential exposure to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single Task Evaluation**: This evaluation examines performance on just one specific clinical documentation task (Assessment & Plan generation) and may not generalize to other medical tasks or to clinical summarization in different specialties or contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simulated Data**: While the ACI-Bench dataset uses realistic simulated conversations, model performance might differ on real-world clinical conversations, which tend to be messier, less structured, and potentially contain more specialized terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Zero-Shot Setting**: Our evaluation uses a zero-shot approach with a specialized system prompt. \n",
    "Performance might improve significantly with few-shot examples.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Domain-specific guidance**: By specifying that the model should act as an \"expert medical scribe,\" we establish the specialized knowledge domain and expected level of expertise.\n",

      "First, Diane is a 28-year-old woman with a history of depression and hypertension. She went to the ER because her blood pressure was really high, almost 200. She felt lightheaded and fell, but her boyfriend caught her. She mentioned that her blood pressure often spikes when she's traveling for work, and she doesn't monitor it as much then because she doesn't bring her cuff. However, she does take her medication, lisinopril, as prescribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor checked her physical exam and found some issues like a heart murmur and slight edema, but nothing too serious. They discussed her depression, and it seems she's managing well with weekly therapy and a strong support system. The doctor decided to increase her lisinopril dose and suggested monitoring her blood pressure more closely. Diane didn't have any other symptoms besides some nasal congestion from allergies.\n",

She mentioned that she went for a walk, felt light-headed, and her boyfriend caught her before she fell. Her blood pressure was almost 200, which is really high. She had a headache and her blood pressure spikes about once a week or month, especially when traveling for work. She doesn't bring her blood pressure cuff, even though she owns one, and she's been taking her lisinopril medication.\n",

      "\n",
      "The doctor then asks about other symptoms, like chest pain or shortness of breath, but the patient doesn't mention them. The doctor suggests reviewing the results, which include an elevated blood pressure, a slight two-out-of-six systolic ejection murmur, and trace pitting edema in the lower extremities. The echocardiogram shows a leaky heart valve and stable heart murmur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor's plan includes increasing lisinopril to 40 mg once a day and considering adding a second agent if needed. They also mention not needing to start medication for depression since the patient is doing well. The patient is asking no questions at this time.\n",

      "The doctor ends by acknowledging the patient's good health and finalizing the note.\n",

She admits she doesn't bring her blood pressure cuff when traveling but has one at home. She is taking her medication, lisinopril, as prescribed.\n",

The doctor also notes that Diane's depression is well-managed with therapy, so no medication is needed for that. Diane doesn't have any questions, and the visit ends.\n",
