## Project Layout

There are two main pulumi stacks in this folder:

`Infra` - This stack is the baseline infra needed for Lumigator to run

`App` - This stack is the app itself, it can be run every time a new code version is deployed.


# Running Pulumi

```
env $(cat .env | xargs) pulumi up
```

# Best Practices

DependsOn / Resource Graph

```
opts=pulumi.ResourceOptions(depends_on=[cluster])
```

https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/inputs-outputs/all/

# Troubleshooting

Sometimes it's easier to apply and `UP` to delete a resource

State manipulation

"Stuck" Resources

opts=pulumi.ResourceOptions(depends_on=[cluster])

Auth tokens, etc timing out after x minutes

Failed up and destroy

Token error

Run both and up and destroy to test that resources created and destroyed correctly.

# EKS ENI issue
https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-eks/issues/382

When destroying EKS clusters, there seems to be an issue with destroying dependent ENIs

```
DependencyViolation: resource sg-0bf103c05a6fd8766 has a dependent object
```

You can see dependent objects for the security group using the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --filters Name=group-id,Values=sg-0bf103c05a6fd8766
```
