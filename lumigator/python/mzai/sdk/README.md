# Lumigator SDK

The SDK provides the communication and validation primitives needed to contact the Lumigator itself,
either locally or remotely.

You can install the lumigator SDK  via `pip` directly or via `uv`:

```bash
pip install lumigator-sdk
```

or 

```bash
uv pip install lumigator-sdk
```


Now that you have the SDK installed, you can use it to communicate with Lumigator. You can run the
[example notebook](/notebooks/walkthrough.ipynb) for a platform API walkthrough, or follow the
[quickstart guide](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/lumigator/get-started/quickstart.html) in the
documentation.
