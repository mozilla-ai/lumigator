    "# Zero-Shot Evaluation of DeepSeek R1 Models for Clinical Conversation Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepSeek family of models represents an interesting advancement in reasoning-specialized language models. While DeepSeek published evaluation results in [their paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948) (see Table 5), I wanted to understand specifically how the various Distilled R1 models compare to the full R1 model on a practical use case: clinical conversation summarization using the ACI-Bench dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Lumigator** to systematically evaluate and compare these models. Lumigator provides a framework to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coordinate multiple model evaluations against the same dataset\n",
    "2. Execute inference requests across different model deployments\n",
    "3. Calculate standardized metrics for performance comparison\n",
    "4. Organize and visualize the results for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Lumigator\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, you'll need to have Lumigator running. In a terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:mozilla-ai/lumigator.git\n",
    "cd lumigator\n",
    "make setup\n",
    "echo $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY # This shouldn't be empty\n",
    "echo $OPENAI_API_KEY # This shouldn't be empty, you need it for G-Eval metric\n",

    "## Dataset: ACI-Bench for Clinical Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation uses the ACI-Bench dataset, which was introduced in the paper \n",
    "[\"ACI-Bench: a Novel Benchmark for Ambient Clinical Intelligence\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02487-3) \n",
    "(Yim et al., 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "ACI-Bench was specifically designed to evaluate AI systems on their ability to \n",
    "understand doctor-patient conversations and generate accurate clinical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The test split of ACI-Bench that we'll be using consists of 40 doctor-patient conversations. \n",
    "These conversations aren't from real patient encounters but were created through professional medical simulations \n",
    "with standardized patients (actors trained to portray patients) and licensed physicians. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach attempts to keep the data reasonably realistic while also being HIPAA-compliant, \n",
    "as no actual protected health information is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each conversation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A full transcript of the simulated clinical encounter, with speaker identification\n",
    "2. Human-written reference documentation\n",
    "3. Various sections of the standard clinical note format (SOAP - Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Assessment & Plan Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this evaluation, we're specifically working with the **assessment and plan section** (`clef_taskC_test3_assessment_and_plan.json`), which is particularly challenging as it requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying the patient's medical conditions\n",
    "- Understanding the physician's diagnostic reasoning\n",
    "- Summarizing the recommended treatment approach\n",
    "- Capturing follow-up plans and contingencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of clinical documentation represents higher-level medical reasoning compared to other sections, making it a interesting test of a model's capacity for complex medical summarization and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in our dataset contains:\n",
    "- `examples`: The full doctor-patient conversation transcript (with speaker turns marked as `[doctor]` and `[patient]`)\n",
    "- `ground_truth`: The human-written assessment and plan section that serves as the reference summary\n",
    "- `id`: A unique identifier for each conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assessment & Plan task was featured in the 2023 MEDIQA-CHAT shared task at CLEF (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum)"

    "### Limitations of This Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation has several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown Training Data Exposure**: We cannot verify whether DeepSeek models were trained on the ACI-Bench dataset or similar clinical conversations. If any of these models were exposed to this data during training, they would have an unfair advantage in this evaluation - essentially having already \"seen the answers\" to the test. Without model cards or detailed training information disclosing training datasets, this remains an unknown factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relative Comparison Focus**: Given this limitation, our analysis primarily focuses on the relative performance differences between models within the DeepSeek family, rather than making absolute claims about their capabilities for clinical summarization. By comparing models from the same family, we can still draw meaningful conclusions about how performance scales with model size and architecture (Llama vs. Qwen) when all models would have had the same potential exposure to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single Task Evaluation**: This evaluation examines performance on just one specific clinical documentation task (Assessment & Plan generation) and may not generalize to other medical tasks or to clinical summarization in different specialties or contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simulated Data**: While the ACI-Bench dataset uses realistic simulated conversations, model performance might differ on real-world clinical conversations, which tend to be messier, less structured, and potentially contain more specialized terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Zero-Shot Setting**: Our evaluation uses a zero-shot approach with a specialized system prompt. \n",
    "Performance might improve significantly with few-shot examples.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Domain-specific guidance**: By specifying that the model should act as an \"expert medical scribe,\" we establish the specialized knowledge domain and expected level of expertise.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to create an Assessment & Plan (A&P) based on the provided conversation between the doctor and the patient. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to understand the key points.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is a 61-year-old male named Alan who came in with complaints of shortness of breath after a long bike ride. He mentioned feeling light-headed and having a hard time catching his breath, which was unusual for him since he bikes every morning. He also reported a little chest pain that went away after an hour. The doctor checked for other symptoms like fever, chest pain, cough, nausea, etc., but Alan didn't have any except for a slight wheeze during the physical exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor noted that Alan's neck was supple, no jugular venous distension, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, and bilateral wheezing in the lungs. There was trace lower extremity edema. The chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests were normal, and the labs were also good. The doctor's impression was that Alan might have had an asthma exacerbation due to exercise and allergies. The plan includes prescribing an albuterol inhaler and referring him to a pulmonologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to structure this into an A&P. The assessment should be a short narrative, and the plan should be a list with nested bullets. I should include medical treatment, patient consent, education, and any other relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the assessment: Alan presented with acute shortness of breath and light-headedness post-exercise, likely related to asthma exacerbation. The physical exam showed wheezing and mild lower extremity edema. Labs and imaging were normal, so the main issue is the acute respiratory symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the plan, the doctor prescribed albuterol and referred him to a pulmonologist. I should list these as the first steps. Then, include patient education about using the inhaler, when to use it, and the importance of following up. Also, mention monitoring for worsening symptoms and the need for follow-up appointments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the plan is clear and actionable. Each bullet should start with a verb, like \"Prescribe,\" \"Refer,\" \"Educate,\" etc. Also, include any necessary information, such as the number of puffs and frequency of use for the inhaler.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to ensure that the assessment is concise but comprehensive, highlighting the key points from the conversation without unnecessary details. The plan should align with the doctor's recommendations and provide a roadmap for Alan's care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any important information. The patient had a history of migraines and reflux, but those were stable. The surgery for cataracts was successful, but that's not directly related to the current issue. So, I can exclude that from the assessment unless it's relevant, which it doesn't seem to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the patient didn't have any other symptoms like fever or chest pain beyond the initial hour, so the main concern is the acute respiratory issue. The wheezing and mild edema point towards asthma, but without more specific findings, it's considered an exacerbation.\n",

      "The doctor did a physical exam and found a slight wheeze in the lungs and trace lower extremity edema. The chest X-ray was normal, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were within normal limits. Labs were also normal. The doctor suspects an asthma exacerbation from exercise and allergies, so they prescribed albuterol and referred him to a pulmonologist. They also plan to follow up in a couple of weeks and monitor his condition.\n",

      "The patient is a 61-year-old male with shortness of breath. He mentions that he recently went on a three-hour bike ride and experienced light-headedness and shortness of breath, which he didn't have before. He also had chest pain that went away after an hour. No other symptoms like fever, cough, or nausea/vomiting were reported. He's never had a cough, and his family is not sick. He's been managing migraines with medication and imitrex, and his reflux is stable. He had cataract surgery four and a half months ago and his vision is fine. The doctor did a physical exam and found a slight bilateral expiratory wheeze and some lower extremity edema. The chest X-ray was normal, and the pulmonary function tests were good. The doctor is considering an asthma exacerbation due to exercise and allergies and plans to prescribe albuterol. He also wants a pulmonary referral and to continue imitrex.\n",
