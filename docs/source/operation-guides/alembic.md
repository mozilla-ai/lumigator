# Using Alembic with Lumigator

[Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) is a lightweight database migration tool for
usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python. In Lumigator, whenever we make changes to the
database (DB) schemas (via our SQLAlchemy models), we must create a migration path for the DB,
removing blockers for developers working on the codebase, and operators upgrading to newer versions
of Lumigator.

For new installations of Lumigator, Alembic is enabled by default to create the database and manage
migrations. This document covers the ways in which Alembic can be used with Lumigator.

```{note}
Alembic creates an additional table (`alembic_version`) in the database which it uses to store the
matching revision ID.
```

## Data model changes

When code changes are made to the data models, or when new models are added, a manual step is
required in order to ensure that the models are visible to Alembic.

First, the imports at the top of [`env.py`](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/blob/main/lumigator/python/mzai/backend/backend/alembic/env.py)
**MUST** import your package:

`from backend.records.{package} import * # noqa: F403`

The reason the wildcard is used is so you don't have to explicitly import *every* type in the
package, which makes this solution more brittle. The comment is required to ignore the
[Flake8 F403](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/F403.html) rule which causes issues with `ruff`
linting.

This ensures that the types are loaded such that the `BaseRecord.metadata` fully represents all our
types to Alembic. If a package is not imported then changes will not be captured by Alembic and
shown in migration revisions.

## Environment variables

In order to connect to a "real" database to compare its state against the codified data models, an
`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` is required to be present in your environment. You can `export` the
variable in your shell, or provide it on each invocation of `alembic`:

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///local.db
```

or

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///local.db alembic history
```

The rest of the document assumes `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` is exported. If `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`
is not present then a default of `sqlite:///local.db` will be used (see:
[here](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/blob/d29a9b290ecb2e13c32cc5a846499ed605c42882/lumigator/python/mzai/backend/alembic.ini#L65)).

If you've followed the `README` for `backend`, you should have sourced the virtual environment. This
means you can run the `alembic` command directly in the terminal. Alternatively, you can also run it
using `uv`:

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ uv run alembic --version
```

## Pre-existing databases (not currently managed by Alembic)

Existing Lumigator operators/contributors may already have a populated database with data they don't
want to lose. In this scenario, the database must be brought under the management of Alembic using
the alembic `stamp` command.

This is done by stamping the database to indicate the version of the revisions that Alembic should
manage going forward.

## My database is up to date

If you believe your database already matches the most up-to-date models:

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic stamp head
```

## My database is in a different state (from a prior release)

This scenario requires manual review of the existing revisions stored in the
[versions folder](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/tree/main/lumigator/python/mzai/backend/backend/alembic/versions),
to determine which revision ID represents the current state of the database containing the data.

Revisions are stored in a format resembling a linked-list, with each revision containing a
`revision` ID and `down_revision` ID (which can be `None` for the initial revision). In each
revision the changes captured in the `upgrade()` method must be examined.

For information on the important information on see [revision structure](#revision-structure).

To align your database with a specific revision (migration ID `e75fa022c781` aligns with the current
state of our database):

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic stamp e75fa022c781
```

## Other Alembic commands

Let us now look at some other useful commands that can be used with Alembic. These commands are
useful for viewing the history of migrations, the current revision, and for upgrading and
downgrading the database.

- Viewing migration history

    ```console
    user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic history
    ```

- Show your current revision

    ```console
    user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic current
    ```

- Upgrading

    - Manually upgrade your database to match the latest models:

        ```console
        user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic upgrade head
        ```

    - You can also upgrade 'relative' to your current state, so to move forwards 1 revision:

        ```console
        user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic upgrade +1
        ```

    - If you know the version you want to migrate to, you can specify it:

        ```console
        user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic upgrade cb3cf47d9259
        ```

- Downgrading

    - To downgrade to the original state (not recommended) use:

        ```console
        user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic downgrade base
        ```

    - You can also downgrade 'relative' to your current state, so to move backwards 1 revision:

        ```console
        user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic downgrade -1
        ```

    - If you know the version you want to migrate to, you can specify it:

        ```console
        user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic upgrade cb3cf47d9259
        ````

## Creating revisions

When you make a change to a database schema via the models, you should create a migration (revision)
that handles upgrading the database, and downgrading too (this allows a linear chain to be followed
when moving between migrations).

To create an empty revision that you populate manually:

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic revision -m "{Explanatory commit-like message}"
```

This will create a new Python file under `[versions/](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/tree/main/lumigator/python/mzai/backend/backend/alembic/versions)`.

For example:

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic revision -m "added desc field to job"
```

should see a new Python file created with a commit/ID prepended to your message:

`cb3cf47d9259_added_desc_field_to_job.py`

Alembic can attempt to work out the changes required to migrate your database if you ask it to
create a revision using the `--autogenerate` flag when creating a revision. This is the recommended
way to create revisions in Lumigator.

```console
user@host:~/lumigator/lumigator/python/mzai/backend$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m {Explanatory commit-like message}
```

Please note that "automatic" doesn't mean this can be completely automated, as manual steps are
still required in **verifying** the output in the generated `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` methods.

## Revision structure

The main parts of the migration Python files Alembic creates are:

| Name            | Purpose                                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `revision`      | ID of this migration                                                         |
| `down_revision` | ID of the previous revision (`None` when this is the first migration)        |
| `upgrade()`     | Function which handles changes required when upgrading to this migration     |
| `downgrade()`   | Function which handles changes required when downgrading from this migration |
