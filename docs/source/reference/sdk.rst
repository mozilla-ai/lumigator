SDK
===

The Lumigator SDK is a Python library that provides a simple interface to interact with the
Lumigator API. You can use it to create, update, delete, and list datasets, submit and monitor jobs,
download the results, request completions, and more.

Lumigator Client
----------------

The main entry point to the SDK is the `LumigatorClient` class. You can create an instance of this
class by providing the Lumigator API host and your Ray cluster address.

.. automodule:: lumigator_sdk.lumigator
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

Health
------

The `Health` class provides a simple interface to check the health of the Lumigator API and the
status of the Ray jobs running on the cluster.

.. automodule:: lumigator_sdk.health
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

Datasets
--------

The `Datasets` class provides a simple interface to create, update, delete, and list datasets.

.. automodule:: lumigator_sdk.lm_datasets
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

Jobs
----

The `Jobs` class provides a simple interface to submit and monitor jobs. Currently, we support two
types of jobs: Inference and Evaluation.

.. automodule:: lumigator_sdk.jobs
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

Completions
-----------

 The `Completions` class provides a simple interface to request completions from external APIs.
 Currently, we support two APIs: OpenAI's and Mistral's.

.. automodule:: lumigator_sdk.completions
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

Base Client
-----------

The `BaseClient` class provides a base class for the LumigatorClient. You can use this class to
create your own client with custom methods.

.. automodule:: lumigator_sdk.client
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
