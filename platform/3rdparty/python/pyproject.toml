# local lm-buddy can be made with the following url spec.
# You have to build the wheel manually and clean out the other wheels that
# are built there - e.g.,

# pushd $WORKSPACE/lm-buddy && \
    # pip wheel . --wheel-dir=$WORKSPACE/wheelhouse  && \
    # cd $WORKSPACE/wheelhouse &&  \
    # mv lm_buddy-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl lm_buddy-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.bak && \
    # rm *.whl && mv lm_buddy-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.bak  lm_buddy-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl && \
    # popd
# after that you can uncomment the following:
# lm-buddy = {verison = "0.11.0", url = "file://${WHEELS_DIR}"}

# pypy version - default
# warning - if you're developing with a copy of this in your system under $WHEELS_DIR,
# in pants.toml, pants will use the local version even without the local URI
# and things will break. make sure to clean it up before building; this is more a note for followups
