# Using Lumigator UI
Lumigator comes with a web-based UI that allows you to interact with the Lumigator API. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a quick way to get started with Lumigator.

## Getting Started
Following the [installation guide](../get-started/installation.md), get Lumigator up and running from the command line:
```console

```
The UI can then be accessed by visiting [localhost](http://localhost) on a web browser. You should be able to see a screen with the sections **Datasets** and **Experiments**. Lets go through each of them in detail.
