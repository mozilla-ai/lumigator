    "\n",
    "+ **Machine learning**: The process of creating a model that learns from data.\n",
    "+ **Dataset**: Data used to train models and evaluate their performance.\n",
    "+ **LLM**: Large language model, [a text-based model that performs next-word predictions](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/).\n",
    "+ **Tokens**: Words broken up into pieces to be used in an LLM.\n",
    "+ **Inference**: The process of getting a prediction from a large language model.\n",
    "+ **Embeddings**: Numerical representations of text generated by modeling.\n",
    "+ **Encoder-decoder models**: A neural network architecture comprised of two neural networks, an\n",
    "  encoder that takes the input vectors from our data and creates an embedding of a fixed length, and\n",
    "  a decoder, also a neural network, which takes the embeddings encoded as input and generates a\n",
    "  static set of outputs such as translated text or a text summary.\n",
    "+ **Decoder-only models** - Given a fixed input prompt, uses its representation to generate a\n",
    "  sequence of words one at a time, with each word being conditioned on the ones generated\n",
    "  previously.\n",
    "+ **Task** - Machine learning tasks to fit a specific model type, including translation,\n",
    "  summarization, completion, etc.\n",
    "+ **Ground truth** - Information that has been evaluated to be true by humans (or LLMs, in some\n",
    "  cases), that we can use to evaluate and compare trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of **machine learning** is the process of creating a mathematical model that tries to\n",
    "approximate the world. A **machine learning model** is a set of instructions for generating a given\n",
    "output from data. The instructions are learned from the features of the input data itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following steps outline the key phases involved in evaluating a Large Language Model (LLM):\n",

    "1. **Generate Ground Truth**: The first step is to establish a reliable ground truth based on the\n",
    "   specific business use case you're targeting. This represents the \"correct\" or expected output\n",
    "   against which model performance will be measured.\n",
    "1. **Select Models for Evaluation**: Next, choose several candidate models that you'd like to\n",
    "   evaluate. These could be different versions of a language model, or distinct models altogether,\n",
    "   depending on your evaluation criteria and use case.\n",
    "1. **Run the Evaluation Loop**: This phase involves running the models through an evaluation process\n",
    "   where you compare the model's outputs against the ground truth. You'll iterate through multiple\n",
    "   examples, assessing how well each model performs in generating the desired results.\n",
    "1. **Analyze Evaluation Results**: Finally, after completing the evaluation loop, you'll analyze the\n",
    "   results to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This analysis helps inform\n",
    "   decisions about which model to use, optimize, or further train for the business use case at hand.\n",
