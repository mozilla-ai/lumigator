    "Neither GPT-4o or DeepSeek R-1 have published exactly what data they've used for training. This means\n",
    "that anything on the internet may have been used in its training and we have no way to verify that \n",
    "any public data wasn't used in the training process. This makes any evaluation we do with public data\n",
    "inherently flawed. If we post it on the internet, it's technically possible to use for LLM training and\n",
    "is no longer a reliable benchmark for future models. \n",

    "that couldn't possibly have been used for training DeepSeek R-1 or GPT-4o!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, the dataset we'll use here is called [SummScreen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07091) ForeverDreaming.\n",
    "It's a dataset of TV show transcripts and their associated recaps. It's useful here for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input transcripts are quite long (>8k tokens) which means that generating a summary is no trivial task.\n",
    "2. For the purposes of this demo, we'll filter down to only Gilmore Girls episodes. \n",
    "   I'm a domain expert in this because I've watched most episodes a few times, so I can judge how good the summary is, in addition to the automatic metrics we get back."
