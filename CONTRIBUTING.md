# Contributing

Lumigator is still in early stages of development and as such will have
large variance between even PATCH versions in terms of feature development.

We want to encourage both suggestions and contributions from the community in the near future. Before submitting a PR, please open a discussion in a related issue.

Currently, we are able to accept:

* PRs for [**bugfixes**](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+) and **documentation** only. Please include as much information as possible;
* [Suggestions](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) on making Lumigator easier to understand and contribute to.
