    "## Generating Data for Ground Truth Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generate a ground truth summary for our data, we first need an input dataset. In this case we use threads from the [Thunderbird public mailing list.](https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/latest).  In order to generate the ground truth and then later evaluate the model, we need at least 100 samples to start with, where a sample is a single email or single email conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our selection criteria: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Collect 100 samples of email thread conversations, as recent as possible and fairly complete so they can be evaluated\n",
    "+ Clean them of email formatting such as `>`\n",
    "+ One consideration here will be that BART, the baseline model we're using, accepts 1024 token context window as input, i.e.  we have to have input email threads that are ~ approximately 1000 words, so keeping on the conservative side\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've collected them, we'd like to take a look at the data before we generate summaries. "

       "1  the Thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: Thunderbird 128 ESR. Now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. Thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2  Hi all, Well I think everything is in the title. We have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). We used to provide PDF.js. Is this still needed? Regards, We usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with Thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. Ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include API changes which could break your add-on as well.

       "3  I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson   \n",
       "4  I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the <html> tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "      <td>I recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, Clippings for Thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that I can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json. John I've removed the beta version of my extension from ATN, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release. Thanks for your help!</td>\n",

       "      <td>the Thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: Thunderbird 128 ESR. Now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. Thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi all, Well I think everything is in the title. We have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). We used to provide PDF.js. Is this still needed? Regards, We usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with Thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. Ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include API changes which could break your add-on as well.

       "      <td>I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"&lt;all_urls&gt;\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson</td>\n",

       "      <td>I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the &lt;html&gt; tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&amp;sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63</td>\n",

       "0  I recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, Clippings for Thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that I can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json. John I've removed the beta version of my extension from ATN, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release.

       "1  the Thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: Thunderbird 128 ESR. Now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. Thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2  Hi all, Well I think everything is in the title. We have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). We used to provide PDF.js. Is this still needed? Regards, We usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with Thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. Ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include API changes which could break your add-on as well.

       "3  I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson   \n",
       "4  I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the <html> tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "0  i recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, clippings for thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that i can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. however, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the add-ons for thunderbird public listing. url to atn listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server i have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on atn. since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to atn at all.my best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from atn,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the xpi files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (i think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted xpi points to the correct update.json. john ive removed the beta version of my extension from atn, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release. thanks for your help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1  the thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: thunderbird 128 esr. now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. if you have not already installed thunderbird beta, you can get it from thunderbirds download page [1]: select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"beta\".\\n\\na list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. these changes mostly affect experiment add-ons, which directly interact with thunderbird code. webextensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesupdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nanother notably change is the official support of manifest version 3 in thunderbird 128. the add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the apis. the full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nstarting with thunderbird 128, the api documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the webextension apis added by thunderbird, but also those inherited from firefox (thunderbird and firefox share a significant amount of code). we are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\ndo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. looking forward to see your add-ons running in thunderbird 128!\\n\\njohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2  hi all, well i think everything is in the title. we have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). we used to provide pdf.js. is this still needed? regards, we usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include api changes which could break your add-on as well. john                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3  im studying how to develop addons. so, im sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nmy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/zulip-thunderbird\\n\\nthe extension adds an icon to open the zulip team chat on a thunderbird tab. the purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. it is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nwithin the zulip chats (same for slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to pdf files, etc... when i left-click on these, the thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nbut i if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. it takes me to firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the pdf, and so on...\\n\\nis there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to firefox? or to make it all work within thunderbird?\\n\\nps: my extension is quite simple and im still learning a lot of details. please feel free to give feedback and tips on what i should improve. i have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nbest regards,\\ngerson\\n\\nhm,\\n\\ni do not know if it is related: do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? it appears those do not work as expected in thunderbird. filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nthe link handler of thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same thunderbird tab. links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nto change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nyou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. in the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addeventlistener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventdefault();\\nevent.stoppropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.opendefaultbrowser(anchor.getattribute(href));\\n}\\n\\ndoes this help?\\n\\njohn\\n\\nyes, at the moment i confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nregarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but i have a busy day of work today. ill test this changes later tonight and ill reply here if it works.\\n\\nive just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nfirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. in zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. to make these work, i need to add the zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nto make this work, i had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onmessage.addlistener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get(zulip_url);\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startswith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.opendefaultbrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addeventlistener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventdefault();\\n    event.stoppropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendmessage({\\n        data: anchor.getattribute(href)\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nill try this for a couple of days to see if i spot other issues. if you have any suggestion on how i can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nthanks for the help,\\nbest regards,\\ngerson  \n",
       "4  i think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how thunderbird works internally, but i thought i would ask anyway.\\n\\nwhen you set mail.tabs.drawintitlebar=true in the config editor, the os-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  this is great.\\n\\nanother thing that happens is that you can drag in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  this is also great.\\n\\ni have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension i have been working on.  i can hide the os-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but i cannot figure out how to make it so i can drag on my extensions toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extensions move.\\n\\ni seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for thunderbirds main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  using the developer toolbox, i just add attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with any values, actually) to the <html> tag in the html/xul for the thunderbird window.  its like magic.  add the chromemargin attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  remove the chromemargin attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you cannot drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nthis does not work for the windows for my extension.  dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\ni have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and i cannot see anything.  perhaps its something in the source code for the app itself?  or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar id, or css class, or attribute or something.  i just dont know.\\n\\ni have tried looking at the thunderbird source code, and i understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nif you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nmany thanks in advance,\\n---mark\\njust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillazine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "

However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json.

If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"&lt;all_urls&gt;\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson</td>\n",

      "- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\n",
      "- host the xpi files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (i think the asset is the better choice),\n",

      "the thunderbird project enjoyed a fantastic 2023. from my point of view – as someone who regularly engages with both the community and our team on a daily basis – the past year brought a renewed sense of purpose, sustainability, and excitement to thunderbird. let’s talk about a few of the awesome milestones thunderbird achieved, but let’s also discuss where we stumbled and what lessons we learned along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "our 2023 milestones\n",
      "the biggest milestone of 2023 was thunderbird 115 “supernova.” this release marked the first step towards a more flexible, reliable, and customizable thunderbird that will accommodate different needs and workflows. work has been long underway to modernize huge amounts of old code, with the aim of modernizing thunderbird to deliver new features even faster. the “supernova” release represented the first fruits of those efforts, and there’s a lot more in the pipeline!\n",
      "\n",
      "alongside supernova came a brand new thunderbird logo to signal the revitalization of the project. we finally (even a bit reluctantly) said goodbye to our beloved “wig on an envelope” and ushered in a new era of thunderbird with a refreshed, redesigned logo. but it was important to honor our roots, which is why we hired jon hicks – the designer of the original firefox and thunderbird logos – to help us bring it to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "one 2023 milestone that deserves more attention is that we hired a dedicated user support specialist! roland tanglao has been working enthusiastically towards removing “documentation debt” and updating the 100s of thunderbird support articles at support.mozilla.org (which you’ll see us refer to internally as “sumo”). beyond that, he keeps a watchful eye on our matrix community support channel for emerging issues, and is in the forums answering as many help questions as humanly possible, alongside our amazing support volunteers. in a nutshell, roland is doing everything he can to improve the experience of asking for and receiving support, modernize existing documentation, and create new guides and articles that make using thunderbird easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "these are some – not all – of our accomplishments from last year. but it’s time to shift focus to where we stumbled, and how we’ll do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "the lessons we learned in 2023\n",
      "in 2023, we failed to finish some of the great features we wanted to bring to thunderbird, including sync and account hub (both of which, however, are still in development). we also missed our target release window for thunderbird on android, after deciding it was worth the extra development time to add the kind of functionality and flexibility you expect from thunderbird software.\n",
      "\n",
      "speaking of functionality you expect, we hear you loud and clear: you want exchange support in thunderbird. we’ve already done some exploratory work, and have enabled the usage of rust in thunderbird. this is a complex topic, but the short version is that this opens the doors for us to start implementing native support for the exchange protocol. it’s officially on our roadmap!\n",
      "\n",
      "we also believe our communication with you has fallen short of where it needs to be. there are times when we get so excited about things we’re working on that it seems like marketing hype. in other situations, we have over-promised and under-delivered because these projects haven’t been extensively scoped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "we’re beginning to solve the latter issue with the recent hiring of kelly mcsweeney, senior technical pm. she joined our team late last year and brings 20 years of valuable experience to thunderbird. in a nutshell, kelly is building processes and tools to accurately gauge how long development time will realistically take, from extensive projects to the tiniest tasks. basically, she’s getting us very organized and making things run much more efficiently! this not only means smoother operations across the organization, but also clearer communication with you going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "and communication is our biggest area of opportunity right now, specifically with our global thunderbird community. we haven’t been as transparent as an open source project should be, nor have we discussed our future plans frequently enough. we’ve had several meetings about this over the past few weeks, and we’re taking immediate steps to do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "to begin with, you’ll start seeing monthly developer digests like this one from alex, aimed at giving you a closer look at the work currently being planned. we’re also increasing our activity on the thunderbird mailing lists, where you can give us direct feedback about future improvements and features.\n",
      "\n",
      "in 2024 you can also look forward to monthly community office hours sessions. this is where you can get some face time (or just voice time) with our team, and watch presentations about upcoming features and improvements by the developer(s) working on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "one last thing: in 2023, thunderbird’s marketing & communications team consisted of myself and wayne mery. this year wayne and i are fortunate to be working alongside new team members heather ellsworth, monica ayhens-madon, and natalia ivanova. together, we’re going to work diligently to create more tutorials on the blog, more video guides, and more content to help you get the most out of thunderbird – with a focus on productivity.\n",

      "hello. a few months ago, i warned of accessibility problems with the new thunderbird interface for blind people who use screen readers such as nvda, for example. at the time, they gave me several suggestions, such as f6 use, stable versions instead of betas, among others. but what most caught my attention is that the developers indicated that there was a concern with accessibility, but that it required time to make the necessary adaptations so that thunderbird did not lose its good accessibility it had so far. however, several months have passed, new betas versions of thunderbird were released, and finally the time of the new interface release for stable versions as well. what has changed since then in terms of accessibility in the new interface for users of screen readers like nvda?! in my humble opinion, absolutely nothing, because the same complaints that i expressed months ago are now present in stable versions. so i decided to return to betas versions to see if anything had improved for the future. unfortunately, no improvement either, because i still have to use tab several times to navigate this new interface. if you decide to use the f6, which is not a comfortable either, i also have to press several times to make the same movement that i performed with a few pressing from the tab key in the previous version. nor can you anymore and couldnt get back there when i made my first complaint about the case, easily browse the content of each message selected in a list of messages within each folder. it is a pity that much has been said, but little has been performed in terms of accessibility in the new thunderbird interface. therefore, im even thinking of going back to the latest stable version before the new interface, and blocking thunderbird updates, a hypothesis that should never be adopted in practice ... thank you.\n",

      "never updating the user interface to the latest design is not really an option. at some point all third-party libraries we’re using will only support the latest platform design. not updating those libraries is also not an option because android itself is constantly changing and requires app/library updates just to keep existing functionality working.\n",

      "\n",
      "we’re currently still in a research phase to figure out what parts of the app need changing. once that’s done, we’ll change the base theme and fix up the app screen by screen. you will be able to follow along by becoming a beta tester and installing k-9 mail 6.9xx beta versions once those become available.\n",

      "the more specific an error message is, the more helpful it is to the user. extreme case is \"an error occurred\" (real example from adobe). also, a message like \"could not read file\" is not helpful to the user: which file? the document? a preference file? is the file not there? is the directory that the app uses the wrong path? is the drive unplugged? do i not have permission? is the file correct? is the data format not recognized? a more helpful message would be \"no permission to read file c:\\tmp\\nsmail.eml\". then i have a specific path that i can check, and i know what the problem is. so, from that, we infer 2 basic rules for good error messages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1. every error case should have a different messages, so that the error message is specific to that problem, and allows the user to know *how* exactly it failed, i.e. which operation failed. (in this case, it was a permission problem.)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2. the error message should contain parameters, so that i know which data or *what* failed. (in this case, the file path name.)\n",
      "\n",
      "that means that developers need to constantly add new error messages, because as they write code, they write error checks, and they need to return the error. therefore, we need to make this easy and efficient to them. if its not easy, then developers will simply re-use an existing error code, and then we end up with generic errors that are unhelpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "so, to make that easy, each module should create its own error messages. close to where the developer is working. i.e. imap backend code generates errors, and the imap code creates the error *message*, with the specific text, and inserts also the parameters/variables in the message.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the jsm loader exposes the module internal more than what the standard esm does, around the global bindings. in order to make the automatic redirection work, currently the new esm loader uses de-optimized compilation mode, for all system esms, both internal files and extensions files. (see https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/56f7d50bd9dcf8b93a9c65d31c4286a735224cc9/js/public/compileoptions.h#318-326).  this results in inefficient execution, and its a performance problem.\n",
      "also, the redirection needs to track the mapping between the old uri and new module, which becomes a memory consumption cost (not so much tho).\n",

       "0   i recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, clippings for thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that i can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. however, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the add-ons for thunderbird public listing. url to atn listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server i have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on atn. since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to atn at all.my best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from atn,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the xpi files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (i think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted xpi points to the correct update.json. john ive removed the beta version of my extension from atn, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release. thanks for your help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1   the thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: thunderbird 128 esr. now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. if you have not already installed thunderbird beta, you can get it from thunderbirds download page [1]: select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"beta\".\\n\\na list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. these changes mostly affect experiment add-ons, which directly interact with thunderbird code. webextensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesupdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nanother notably change is the official support of manifest version 3 in thunderbird 128. the add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the apis. the full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nstarting with thunderbird 128, the api documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the webextension apis added by thunderbird, but also those inherited from firefox (thunderbird and firefox share a significant amount of code). we are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\ndo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. looking forward to see your add-ons running in thunderbird 128!\\n\\njohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2   hi all, well i think everything is in the title. we have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). we used to provide pdf.js. is this still needed? regards, we usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include api changes which could break your add-on as well. john                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3   im studying how to develop addons. so, im sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nmy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/zulip-thunderbird\\n\\nthe extension adds an icon to open the zulip team chat on a thunderbird tab. the purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. it is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nwithin the zulip chats (same for slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to pdf files, etc... when i left-click on these, the thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nbut i if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. it takes me to firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the pdf, and so on...\\n\\nis there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to firefox? or to make it all work within thunderbird?\\n\\nps: my extension is quite simple and im still learning a lot of details. please feel free to give feedback and tips on what i should improve. i have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nbest regards,\\ngerson\\n\\nhm,\\n\\ni do not know if it is related: do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? it appears those do not work as expected in thunderbird. filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nthe link handler of thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same thunderbird tab. links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nto change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nyou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. in the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addeventlistener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventdefault();\\nevent.stoppropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.opendefaultbrowser(anchor.getattribute(href));\\n}\\n\\ndoes this help?\\n\\njohn\\n\\nyes, at the moment i confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nregarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but i have a busy day of work today. ill test this changes later tonight and ill reply here if it works.\\n\\nive just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nfirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. in zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. to make these work, i need to add the zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nto make this work, i had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onmessage.addlistener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get(zulip_url);\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startswith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.opendefaultbrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addeventlistener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventdefault();\\n    event.stoppropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendmessage({\\n        data: anchor.getattribute(href)\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nill try this for a couple of days to see if i spot other issues. if you have any suggestion on how i can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nthanks for the help,\\nbest regards,\\ngerson   \n",
       "4   i think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how thunderbird works internally, but i thought i would ask anyway.\\n\\nwhen you set mail.tabs.drawintitlebar=true in the config editor, the os-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  this is great.\\n\\nanother thing that happens is that you can drag in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  this is also great.\\n\\ni have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension i have been working on.  i can hide the os-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but i cannot figure out how to make it so i can drag on my extensions toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extensions move.\\n\\ni seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for thunderbirds main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  using the developer toolbox, i just add attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with any values, actually) to the <html> tag in the html/xul for the thunderbird window.  its like magic.  add the chromemargin attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  remove the chromemargin attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you cannot drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nthis does not work for the windows for my extension.  dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\ni have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and i cannot see anything.  perhaps its something in the source code for the app itself?  or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar id, or css class, or attribute or something.  i just dont know.\\n\\ni have tried looking at the thunderbird source code, and i understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nif you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nmany thanks in advance,\\n---mark\\njust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillazine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "95  whoever thought monochrome icons were better than colored (or coloured) ones must have a strange outlook on life.  whats wrong with having a background color attribute for icons, which if a user wants monochrome, can all be set the same?  i use tabs a lot, and particularly dislike the release 78 tabs all being black & white.  arguments about how to make icons readily distinguishable by shape, miss the point:  colour is the obvious way to make different tab categories immediately distinguishable.  even if all black & white is the default, the user should be able to assign colours by category, like the previous version where all tabs containing regular folders were yellow, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       " ('the thunderbird project enjoyed a fantastic 2023. from my point of view – as someone who regularly engages with both the community and our team on a daily basis – the past year brought a renewed sense of purpose, sustainability, and excitement to thunderbird. let’s talk about a few of the awesome milestones thunderbird achieved, but let’s also discuss where we stumbled and what lessons we learned along the way.\\n\\nour 2023 milestones\\nthe biggest milestone of 2023 was thunderbird 115 “supernova.” this release marked the first step towards a more flexible, reliable, and customizable thunderbird that will accommodate different needs and workflows. work has been long underway to modernize huge amounts of old code, with the aim of modernizing thunderbird to deliver new features even faster. the “supernova” release represented the first fruits of those efforts, and there’s a lot more in the pipeline!\\n\\nalongside supernova came a brand new thunderbird logo to signal the revitalization of the project. we finally (even a bit reluctantly) said goodbye to our beloved “wig on an envelope” and ushered in a new era of thunderbird with a refreshed, redesigned logo. but it was important to honor our roots, which is why we hired jon hicks – the designer of the original firefox and thunderbird logos – to help us bring it to life.\\n\\none 2023 milestone that deserves more attention is that we hired a dedicated user support specialist! roland tanglao has been working enthusiastically towards removing “documentation debt” and updating the 100s of thunderbird support articles at support.mozilla.org (which you’ll see us refer to internally as “sumo”). beyond that, he keeps a watchful eye on our matrix community support channel for emerging issues, and is in the forums answering as many help questions as humanly possible, alongside our amazing support volunteers. in a nutshell, roland is doing everything he can to improve the experience of asking for and receiving support, modernize existing documentation, and create new guides and articles that make using thunderbird easier.\\n\\nthese are some – not all – of our accomplishments from last year. but it’s time to shift focus to where we stumbled, and how we’ll do better.\\n\\nthe lessons we learned in 2023\\nin 2023, we failed to finish some of the great features we wanted to bring to thunderbird, including sync and account hub (both of which, however, are still in development). we also missed our target release window for thunderbird on android, after deciding it was worth the extra development time to add the kind of functionality and flexibility you expect from thunderbird software.\\n\\nspeaking of functionality you expect, we hear you loud and clear: you want exchange support in thunderbird. we’ve already done some exploratory work, and have enabled the usage of rust in thunderbird. this is a complex topic, but the short version is that this opens the doors for us to start implementing native support for the exchange protocol. it’s officially on our roadmap!\\n\\nwe also believe our communication with you has fallen short of where it needs to be. there are times when we get so excited about things we’re working on that it seems like marketing hype. in other situations, we have over-promised and under-delivered because these projects haven’t been extensively scoped out.\\n\\nwe’re beginning to solve the latter issue with the recent hiring of kelly mcsweeney, senior technical pm. she joined our team late last year and brings 20 years of valuable experience to thunderbird. in a nutshell, kelly is building processes and tools to accurately gauge how long development time will realistically take, from extensive projects to the tiniest tasks. basically, she’s getting us very organized and making things run much more efficiently! this not only means smoother operations across the organization, but also clearer communication with you going forward.\\n\\nand communication is our biggest area of opportunity right now, specifically with our global thunderbird community. we haven’t been as transparent as an open source project should be, nor have we discussed our future plans frequently enough. we’ve had several meetings about this over the past few weeks, and we’re taking immediate steps to do better.\\n\\nto begin with, you’ll start seeing monthly developer digests like this one from alex, aimed at giving you a closer look at the work currently being planned. we’re also increasing our activity on the thunderbird mailing lists, where you can give us direct feedback about future improvements and features.\\n\\nin 2024 you can also look forward to monthly community office hours sessions. this is where you can get some face time (or just voice time) with our team, and watch presentations about upcoming features and improvements by the developer(s) working on them.\\n\\none last thing: in 2023, thunderbird’s marketing & communications team consisted of myself and wayne mery. this year wayne and i are fortunate to be working alongside new team members heather ellsworth, monica ayhens-madon, and natalia ivanova. together, we’re going to work diligently to create more tutorials on the blog, more video guides, and more content to help you get the most out of thunderbird – with a focus on productivity.\\n\\nthank you for being on this journey with us, and dont hesitate to let us know whats on your mind!\\n\\n~jason\\nthunderbird community engagement manager',\n",

(bug 1888023)\\n(hopefully early next week) ill be changing the keys thunderbird uses to encrypt your data. firefox will not be able to read your thunderbird sync data and thunderbird will not be able to read your firefox sync data². well also be moving to mozilla accounts new authentication flow. (bug 1888019)\\nyou may need to sign thunderbird in to your account again.\\n\\n(soon) well begin storing thunderbird data on our own servers, separate from firefox data.\\n\\nfinally, when were sure everything is working as intended, well change the thunderbird configuration to move everything from the staging servers to the production servers. only then will sync be enabled in thunderbird beta and the release channels. (possibly esr 128, no promises!)\\nyou will need to sign thunderbird in again, and this time use your real mozilla accounts email and password.\\n\\nwith each of these changes your existing data will either be wiped from the storage server, or thunderbird will no longer be able to read it. if you use sync to set up new profiles, first load and sync an existing profile in an updated daily and ensure that it uploads fresh data.\\n\\nhappy syncing!\\ngl\\n\\n¹ … including address books and calendars, as before, but im not going to write it out every time.\\n\\n² this is the change mozilla insisted on before allowing us to use mozilla accounts, and why its take so long to get to this stage.',\n",

(in this case, it was a permission problem.)\\n\\n1.2. the error message should contain parameters, so that i know which data or *what* failed. (in this case, the file path name.)\\n\\nthat means that developers need to constantly add new error messages, because as they write code, they write error checks, and they need to return the error. therefore, we need to make this easy and efficient to them. if its not easy, then developers will simply re-use an existing error code, and then we end up with generic errors that are unhelpful.\\n\\nso, to make that easy, each module should create its own error messages. close to where the developer is working. i.e. imap backend code generates errors, and the imap code creates the error *message*, with the specific text, and inserts also the parameters/variables in the message.\\n\\nthis is particularly important as the same code might be called from different windows, which both need to display the message.\\n\\nthe only other alternative would be a global error code and error message list. however, the ui would still need to insert the variables into the message, which would need to be passed separately. furthermore, additions to that global list would be prone to code-level conflicts of different devs working on different features which both add errors.\\n\\nthats why in practice, it works best when each module is responsible for creating the error message, in a user-readable form, directly for display verbatim to the end user.\\n\\n\\n\\na good error message is:\\n\\n* specific to the problem\\n* contains parameters showing what exactly is failing\\n* explains the problem in a way a user can understand (and experts still understand it), without making it too generic.\\n* suggests how the problem might be solved (without stating the obvious)\\n\\nben',\n",

(see https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/56f7d50bd9dcf8b93a9c65d31c4286a735224cc9/js/public/compileoptions.h#318-326).  this results in inefficient execution, and its a performance problem.\\nalso, the redirection needs to track the mapping between the old uri and new module, which becomes a memory consumption cost (not so much tho).\\n\\nso, this automatic redirection feature comes both with the maintenance cost and the runtime cost, and keeping it for many years isnt desirable, both for developers and users.\\n\\nif youre having trouble around the migration, were happy to help.  feel free to ask in https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#esmification:mozilla.org room (sorry, i noticed the first message doesnt have the link)',\n",

      "0   i recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, clippings for thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that i can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. however, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the add-ons for thunderbird public listing. url to atn listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server i have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on atn. since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to atn at all.my best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from atn,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the xpi files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (i think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted xpi points to the correct update.json. john ive removed the beta version of my extension from atn, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release. thanks for your help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
      "1   the thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: thunderbird 128 esr. now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. if you have not already installed thunderbird beta, you can get it from thunderbirds download page [1]: select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"beta\".\\n\\na list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. these changes mostly affect experiment add-ons, which directly interact with thunderbird code. webextensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesupdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nanother notably change is the official support of manifest version 3 in thunderbird 128. the add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the apis. the full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nstarting with thunderbird 128, the api documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the webextension apis added by thunderbird, but also those inherited from firefox (thunderbird and firefox share a significant amount of code). we are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\ndo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. looking forward to see your add-ons running in thunderbird 128!\\n\\njohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
      "2   hi all, well i think everything is in the title. we have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). we used to provide pdf.js. is this still needed? regards, we usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include api changes which could break your add-on as well. john                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "3   im studying how to develop addons. so, im sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nmy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/zulip-thunderbird\\n\\nthe extension adds an icon to open the zulip team chat on a thunderbird tab. the purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. it is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nwithin the zulip chats (same for slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to pdf files, etc... when i left-click on these, the thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nbut i if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. it takes me to firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the pdf, and so on...\\n\\nis there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to firefox? or to make it all work within thunderbird?\\n\\nps: my extension is quite simple and im still learning a lot of details. please feel free to give feedback and tips on what i should improve. i have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nbest regards,\\ngerson\\n\\nhm,\\n\\ni do not know if it is related: do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? it appears those do not work as expected in thunderbird. filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nthe link handler of thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same thunderbird tab. links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nto change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nyou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. in the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addeventlistener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventdefault();\\nevent.stoppropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.opendefaultbrowser(anchor.getattribute(href));\\n}\\n\\ndoes this help?\\n\\njohn\\n\\nyes, at the moment i confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nregarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but i have a busy day of work today. ill test this changes later tonight and ill reply here if it works.\\n\\nive just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nfirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. in zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. to make these work, i need to add the zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nto make this work, i had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onmessage.addlistener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get(zulip_url);\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startswith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.opendefaultbrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addeventlistener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventdefault();\\n    event.stoppropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendmessage({\\n        data: anchor.getattribute(href)\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nill try this for a couple of days to see if i spot other issues. if you have any suggestion on how i can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nthanks for the help,\\nbest regards,\\ngerson   \n",
      "4   i think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how thunderbird works internally, but i thought i would ask anyway.\\n\\nwhen you set mail.tabs.drawintitlebar=true in the config editor, the os-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  this is great.\\n\\nanother thing that happens is that you can drag in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  this is also great.\\n\\ni have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension i have been working on.  i can hide the os-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but i cannot figure out how to make it so i can drag on my extensions toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extensions move.\\n\\ni seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for thunderbirds main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  using the developer toolbox, i just add attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with any values, actually) to the <html> tag in the html/xul for the thunderbird window.  its like magic.  add the chromemargin attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  remove the chromemargin attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you cannot drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nthis does not work for the windows for my extension.  dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\ni have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and i cannot see anything.  perhaps its something in the source code for the app itself?  or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar id, or css class, or attribute or something.  i just dont know.\\n\\ni have tried looking at the thunderbird source code, and i understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nif you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nmany thanks in advance,\\n---mark\\njust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillazine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

      "95  whoever thought monochrome icons were better than colored (or coloured) ones must have a strange outlook on life.  whats wrong with having a background color attribute for icons, which if a user wants monochrome, can all be set the same?  i use tabs a lot, and particularly dislike the release 78 tabs all being black & white.  arguments about how to make icons readily distinguishable by shape, miss the point:  colour is the obvious way to make different tab categories immediately distinguishable.  even if all black & white is the default, the user should be able to assign colours by category, like the previous version where all tabs containing regular folders were yellow, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
