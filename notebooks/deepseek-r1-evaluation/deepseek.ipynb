    "# Zero-Shot Evaluation of DeepSeek R1 Models for Clinical Conversation Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepSeek family of models represents an interesting advancement in reasoning-specialized language models. While DeepSeek published evaluation results in [their paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948) (see Table 5), I wanted to understand specifically how the various Distilled R1 models compare to the full R1 model on a practical use case: clinical conversation summarization using the ACI-Bench dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Lumigator** to systematically evaluate and compare these models. Lumigator provides a framework to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coordinate multiple model evaluations against the same dataset\n",
    "2. Execute inference requests across different model deployments\n",
    "3. Calculate standardized metrics for performance comparison\n",
    "4. Organize and visualize the results for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Lumigator\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, you'll need to have Lumigator running. In a terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:mozilla-ai/lumigator.git\n",
    "cd lumigator\n",
    "make setup\n",
    "echo $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY # This shouldn't be empty\n",
    "echo $OPENAI_API_KEY # This shouldn't be empty, you need it for G-Eval metric\n",

    "## Dataset: ACI-Bench for Clinical Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation uses the ACI-Bench dataset, which was introduced in the paper \n",
    "[\"ACI-Bench: a Novel Benchmark for Ambient Clinical Intelligence\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02487-3) \n",
    "(Yim et al., 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "ACI-Bench was specifically designed to evaluate AI systems on their ability to \n",
    "understand doctor-patient conversations and generate accurate clinical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The test split of ACI-Bench that we'll be using consists of 40 doctor-patient conversations. \n",
    "These conversations aren't from real patient encounters but were created through professional medical simulations \n",
    "with standardized patients (actors trained to portray patients) and licensed physicians. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach attempts to keep the data reasonably realistic while also being HIPAA-compliant, \n",
    "as no actual protected health information is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each conversation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A full transcript of the simulated clinical encounter, with speaker identification\n",
    "2. Human-written reference documentation\n",
    "3. Various sections of the standard clinical note format (SOAP - Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Assessment & Plan Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this evaluation, we're specifically working with the **assessment and plan section** (`clef_taskC_test3_assessment_and_plan.json`), which is particularly challenging as it requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying the patient's medical conditions\n",
    "- Understanding the physician's diagnostic reasoning\n",
    "- Summarizing the recommended treatment approach\n",
    "- Capturing follow-up plans and contingencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of clinical documentation represents higher-level medical reasoning compared to other sections, making it a interesting test of a model's capacity for complex medical summarization and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in our dataset contains:\n",
    "- `examples`: The full doctor-patient conversation transcript (with speaker turns marked as `[doctor]` and `[patient]`)\n",
    "- `ground_truth`: The human-written assessment and plan section that serves as the reference summary\n",
    "- `id`: A unique identifier for each conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assessment & Plan task was featured in the 2023 MEDIQA-CHAT shared task at CLEF (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum)"

    "### Limitations of This Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation has several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown Training Data Exposure**: We cannot verify whether DeepSeek models were trained on the ACI-Bench dataset or similar clinical conversations. If any of these models were exposed to this data during training, they would have an unfair advantage in this evaluation - essentially having already \"seen the answers\" to the test. Without model cards or detailed training information disclosing training datasets, this remains an unknown factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relative Comparison Focus**: Given this limitation, our analysis primarily focuses on the relative performance differences between models within the DeepSeek family, rather than making absolute claims about their capabilities for clinical summarization. By comparing models from the same family, we can still draw meaningful conclusions about how performance scales with model size and architecture (Llama vs. Qwen) when all models would have had the same potential exposure to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single Task Evaluation**: This evaluation examines performance on just one specific clinical documentation task (Assessment & Plan generation) and may not generalize to other medical tasks or to clinical summarization in different specialties or contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simulated Data**: While the ACI-Bench dataset uses realistic simulated conversations, model performance might differ on real-world clinical conversations, which tend to be messier, less structured, and potentially contain more specialized terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Zero-Shot Setting**: Our evaluation uses a zero-shot approach with a specialized system prompt. \n",
    "Performance might improve significantly with few-shot examples.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Domain-specific guidance**: By specifying that the model should act as an \"expert medical scribe,\" we establish the specialized knowledge domain and expected level of expertise.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to create an Assessment and Plan (A&P) summary based on the provided medical transcript. The user wants me to generate a concise A&P that's problem-oriented, with the assessment as a short narrative and the plan as a list with nested bullets. They also mentioned including information about medical treatment, patient consent, patient education, and medical reasoning when appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll start by identifying the key points from the conversation. The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of migraines and reflux. He recently had a bike ride and experienced shortness of breath and felt light-headed, which is concerning because he's usually fine without issues. His symptoms included difficulty breathing, slight chest pain that resolved, and no fever. He has no other symptoms, family issues, or cough. His vital signs are normal, and physical exam shows no issues except for a slight wheezing sound in the lungs. The chest x-ray is normal, and his pulmonary function tests are good. His labs are all normal, so he's prescribed albuterol inhaler for two puffs every four hours. He's also referred for a pulmonary follow-up. His reflux and migraines are stable, so treatment continues as is. He's to be seen in two weeks if symptoms persist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the assessment, I need to summarize the patient's condition. He likely had an asthma exacerbation from his recent exertion.

His vital signs are normal, and physical exam shows no jugular venous distension, regular heart rhythm, and trace lower extremity edema. Chest x-ray and labs are normal. His pulmonary function tests are good, and he has been prescribed albuterol inhaler for two puffs every four hours as needed. A pulmonary referral has been ordered for further evaluation.
